YADR-Next
=========

YADR-Next is a lightweight, low-maintenance fork of YADR, a powerful dotfiles management system for Vim, Tmux, and other terminal tools.

This fork:
•	Removes deprecated Ruby methods.
•	Adds my personal favorite configurations.
•	Removes unnecessary packages for a cleaner setup.

Feel free to customize after cloning to make it your own!

⸻

If you want, I can also make an even punchier, one-paragraph version that’s more likely to grab GitHub stars. Do you want me to do that?

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dainmiller/yadr-next/master/install.sh | sh
```
