YADR-Next
=========

YADR-Next is a lightweight, low-maintenance fork of YADR, a powerful dotfiles management system for Vim, Tmux, and other terminal tools.

This fork:
  - Removes deprecated Ruby methods.
  - Adds my personal favorite configurations.
  - Removes unnecessary packages for a cleaner setup.

Feel free to customize after cloning to make it your own!
