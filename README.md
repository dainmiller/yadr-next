YADR is a great management system for your dotfiles (assuming you use: vim, tmux, etc).

YADR-Next is a low maintenance fork. I removed the Ruby methods that were depricated, and added a bunch of my favorite configs/removed some packages. But feel free to customize after you download it.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dainmiller/yadr-next/master/install.sh | sh
```
